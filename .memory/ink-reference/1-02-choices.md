# Choices
*Part 1 of Writing with ink*


Input is offered to the player via text choices. A text choice is indicated by an `*` character.

If no other flow instructions are given, once made, the choice will flow into the next line of text.

```ink
Hello world!
*	Hello back!
	Nice to hear from you!
```

This produces the following game:

```text
Hello world!
1: Hello back!

> 1
Hello back!
Nice to hear from you!
```

By default, the text of a choice appears again, in the output.

### Suppressing choice text

Some games separate the text of a choice from its outcome. In **ink**, if the choice text is given in square brackets, the text of the choice will not be printed into response.

```ink
Hello world!
*	[Hello back!]
	Nice to hear from you!
```

produces

```text
Hello world!
1: Hello back!

> 1
Nice to hear from you!
```

#### Advanced: mixing choice and output text

The square brackets in fact divide up the option content. What's before is printed in both choice and output; what's inside only in choice; and what's after, only in output. Effectively, they provide alternative ways for a line to end.

```ink
Hello world!
*	Hello [back!] right back to you!
	Nice to hear from you!
```

produces:

```text
Hello world!
1: Hello back!
> 1
Hello right back to you!
Nice to hear from you!
```

This is most useful when writing dialogue choices:

```ink
"What's that?" my master asked.
*	"I am somewhat tired[."]," I repeated.
	"Really," he responded. "How deleterious."
```

produces:

```text
"What's that?" my master asked.
1: "I am somewhat tired."
> 1
"I am somewhat tired," I repeated.
"Really," he responded. "How deleterious."
```

### Multiple Choices

To make choices really choices, we need to provide alternatives. We can do this simply by listing them:

```ink
"What's that?" my master asked.
*	"I am somewhat tired[."]," I repeated.
	"Really," he responded. "How deleterious."
*	"Nothing, Monsieur!"[] I replied.
	"Very good, then."
*  "I said, this journey is appalling[."] and I want no more of it."
	"Ah," he replied, not unkindly. "I see you are feeling frustrated. Tomorrow, things will improve."
```

This produces the following game:

```text
"What's that?" my master asked.

1: "I am somewhat tired."
2: "Nothing, Monsieur!"
3: "I said, this journey is appalling."

> 3
"I said, this journey is appalling and I want no more of it."
"Ah," he replied, not unkindly. "I see you are feeling frustrated. Tomorrow, things will improve."
```

The above syntax is enough to write a single set of choices. In a real game, we'll want to move the flow from one point to another based on what the player chooses. To do that, we need to introduce a bit more structure.
